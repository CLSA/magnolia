SET note_fr = "In order to assess Functional Status (FUL) in Comprehensive participants who benefited from an accommodation strategy (ex. DCS by phone), this questionnaire was administered. For 134 participants, the baseline DCS visit was completed by phone for various reasons including time constraints for recruitment fulfillment toward the end of Baseline data collection and some cases where the participants were unable to physically present at the DCS but wished to remain part of CLSA. For 2 participants, the Baseline DCS site visit was completed in person at the participantâ€™s residence as a pilot for the DCS at home. For 1 participant, the Baseline DCS consisted of a DCS site visit for the collection of physical measures with the questionnaires being administered by phone."
